# WPFChoice
The project is built based on WPF theme. The idea is to read 2 XML files: one is database and the other is the restriction.
Expected behaviour: when user pick a choice in any component, that choice should be stored in an preAnsList to apply the restrictions (or filter) to all choices of other components
